					What kind of jobs can I run on Hungry Hippos platform?
				</p>
				<p class="answer">You can run almost all jobs that you can run on Hadoop platform.</p>
				<p></p>

				<p id="maximumSizeOfData" class="question">
					What is the maximum size of data for which I can submit jobs for, using this tester web application?
				</p>
				<p>
					It really depends on RAM and CPU requirement of job/computation you are trying to perform. But as this tool is made available for testing purposes, 
					you can run jobs of maximum data size of 30 GB and computations that can be accommodated in 2GB RAM on one node.
					This limitation is because when you submit a job, we create a 10 nodes cluster with each node having 2GB RAM and 40 GB hard disk.     
				</p>
				<p>We have successfully tested computations on data of size of 10GB for sum and median metric calculations.</p>

				<p id="dataLocation" class="question">
					Where should I put my data?
				</p>
				<p>
					Data should be available and accessible over internet.
