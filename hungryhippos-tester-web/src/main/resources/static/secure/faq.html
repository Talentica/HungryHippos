				<p id="kindOfJobsCanRun" class="question">
					What kind of jobs can I run on Hungry Hippos platform?
				</p>
				<p class="answer">You can run almost all types of jobs that you can run on Hadoop platform.</p>
				<p></p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="maximumSizeOfData" class="question">
					What is the maximum size of data for which I can submit jobs for, using this tester web application?
				</p>
				<p>
					It really depends on RAM and CPU requirement of job/computation you are trying to perform. 
					But as this application is made available for testing purposes right now, 
					you can run jobs of maximum data size of 30 GB and computations that can be run on 2GB RAM on one node.
					This limitation is because when you submit a job, we create a 10 nodes cluster with each node having 2GB RAM 
					and 40 GB hard disk.     
				</p>
				<p>We have successfully tested computations on data of size of 10GB for sum and median metric calculations.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="dataLocation" class="question">
					Where should I put my data?
				</p>
				<p>
					Your data should be available and accessible over internet. You can use Amazon S3, Digital Ocean, 
					<a href="https://uploadfiles.io/" target="_blank">UploadFiles</a> or your own server accessible over internet.       
				</p>
				<p></p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="fileFormats" class="question">
					What all file formats are supported?
				</p>
				<p>
					As of now only CSV file format is supported.       
				</p>
				<p></p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="multipleJobs" class="question">
					Can I submit multiple jobs in the one go?					
				</p>
				<p>Yes. You can submit a job matrix which contains more than one job definitions.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="languagesSupported" class="question">
						Which languages can I write job matrix implementation in?			
				</p>
				<p>As of now, only 'Java' is supported.</p>
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<p id="whatToImplementForJobMatrix" class="question">
						What code do I need to write for job matrix?			
				</p>
				<p>
					You need to provide your own implementation of com.talentica.hungryHippos.client.job.JobMatrix interface.
					For more details on client API please refer javadocs <a href="{{client_api_documentation}}" target="_blank">here</a> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Please download the current version of hungry hippos client JAR from <a href="{{client_jar_location}}">here</a>
				<p>
					You can also refer to few sample job matrix implementations from <a href="{{test_job_matrix_jar_location}}">here</a>.
